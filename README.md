# 🌍 VastlySim — Domain-Agnostic Agent & Exchange Simulation Framework

**VastlySim** is an open-source C# framework for simulating interactions between autonomous agents across customizable exchange systems.  
It’s built to be **modular**, **extensible**, and **domain-agnostic**, allowing seamless experimentation and system modeling across **economics**, **psychology**, **biology**, and **game design**.

## 🔩 Core Modules [Early development stage]

### 🧠 Agents
Create intelligent, goal-driven entities with customizable behaviors and reactions.

### ⚙️ Exchange Systems
Define the rules of interaction, from financial order books to social or ecological exchanges.

### ⏱️ Tick Engine
Drive simulations with deterministic, time-stepped updates that scale from real-time to batch processing.

### 🧮 Simulation Module
Run aggregated scenario simulations to analyze macro-level outcomes and optimize computation.

## 🧠 Designed For

- **Researchers** — Simulate behavioral, economic, or ecological systems with reproducible and extensible logic.
- **Game Developers** — Integrate agent-based economies or complex multi-agent behaviors directly into gameplay.
- **Developers & Engineers** — Extend the framework’s tick engine or exchange logic to power simulations in any domain.

---

## 🚀 Vision

VastlySim aims to become a **universal simulation framework** — where every system of interacting agents, regardless of domain, can be expressed, analyzed, and evolved.  
The project will expand to **multiple languages** and **interoperability layers** (e.g., Python, WebAssembly) while remaining **open source** and **community-driven**.
